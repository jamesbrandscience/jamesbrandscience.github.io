# copying-task plugin

## Overview

This plugin runs a copying task. In a trial, an example grid (the "model", containing various stimuli) on the left must replicated in the middle grid (the "workspace"). To do this stimuli from the right grid (the "resources") can be picked up and dragged to the middle grid. You can use imgage files (e.g., .jpg/.png/.gif) as stimuli, or built in 'nonsense' shape stimuli in any color. The plugin records the actions of the participant what items are picked up and where they are placed.
