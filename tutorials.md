## Tutorials

Below you can find a number of different tutorials and online resources I have developed on various topics. Please feel free to use and share them.

#### JsPsych and Cognition.run

[Session 1](https://jamesbrandscience.github.io/jspsych-tutorial/jspsych_1.html) - Introduction
[Session 2](https://jamesbrandscience.github.io/jspsych-tutorial/jspsych_2.html) - Building experiments: basics
[Session 3](https://jamesbrandscience.github.io/jspsych-tutorial/jspsych_3.html) - Building experiments: intermediate
[Session 4](https://jamesbrandscience.github.io/jspsych-tutorial/jspsych_4.html) - Building experiments: advanced

> An introductory course on how to program experiments in JsPsych and host them using cognition.run. This course is aimed at researchers without access to their own server to still understand and implement online research, collect data from participants and process the data. This course is under construction, I am aiming to extend the course to a 10 week module, but at the moment it will likely take 5-6 hours to work through the sessions.

#### R Minikurz - [Tidyverse](https://jamesbrandscience.github.io/tutorials/ERCEL/ERCEL_tidyverse.html) and [ggplot](https://jamesbrandscience.github.io/tutorials/ERCEL/ERCEL_ggplot.html)

> An introductory course on how to use R and the tidyverse. This is for beginners who may not be too confident using R or for those who are more familiar with base functions and want to adopt a tidy philosophy

#### [Lancaster Sensorimotor Norms shiny app](https://embodiedcognitionlab.shinyapps.io/sensorimotor_norms/)

> An interactive app written in R (using shiny) to allow users to explore the Lancaster Sensorimotor norms database ([Lynott et al. 2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-019-01316-z))

#### [Vowel plot animations](https://jamesbrandscience.github.io/tutorials/Vowel_animations.html)

> A short exploration of how to visualise changes in F1/F2 of vowels, this focuses on sound change over a year of birth variable, but is applicable to a range of different dynamic trajectories

#### [Introduction to open science practices](https://jamesbrandscience.github.io/tutorials/open_science/Introduction.html)

> Introduction to key concepts, terminology and practices used for open science, this outlines why researchers may reap the benefits of a more open and transparent workflow (workshop given at NZLS)

#### [GitHub for beginners](https://jamesbrandscience.github.io/tutorials/GitHub_stats_chat/GitHub.html)

> A step-by-step guide on how to set up and use GitHub and integrate it within your research workflow, this is aimed at those who have never used GitHub (tutorial given at NZILBB stats-chat)

#### [Data exploration and visualisation](https://jamesbrandscience.github.io/LASS_workshop_ggplot2/Day_2.html)

> A detailed outline of how and why data exploration and visualisation steps can help get to know you data better (tutorial given as part of the LASS workshop)

#### [Artificial language learning](https://github.com/jamesbrandscience/SSoL_2018)

> Workshop on how to use artificial language learning paradigms to investigate language learning and evolution in a laboratory setting (workshop given at SSoL)
