### Dobr√Ω den!

I am a research scientist at the Faculty of Arts at Charles University/Univerzita Karlova, where I am the principal investigator of a [PRIMUS](https://cuni.cz/UKEN-558.html) grant called SocioLex. You can read more about the project [here].

Previously, I have worked as a Post-doctoral Research Fellow at [the NZILLB](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/nzilbb/) - University of Canterbury in New Zealand, researching the sociolinguistic factors of sound change. I was also a Post-doc in the [Embodied Cognition Lab](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/connelll/lab/) at Lancaster University.

I completed my PhD at Lancaster University under the supervision of [Prof Padraic Monaghan](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/monaghan/) and [Dr Peter Walker](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/psychology/people/peter-walker/)

#### Research Interests
How do cognitive biases shape our language? My research focuses on the different ways
that our language is shaped by the brain, with a specific focus on the way languages are learnt, processed and subsequently evolve. I combine experimental methods, corpus based analyses and computational approaches to address my research questions, along with quantitative data analysis. This approach is highly multidisciplinary, with the aim being to answer and generate questions that have implications for areas of psychology, linguistics and the cognitive sciences.
