<h2>Hello, world!</h2>
<p>How do cognitive biases shape our language? My research focuses on the different ways
that our language is shaped by the brain, addressing how language acquisition and use can
explain many fundamental properties of language. I adopt a variety of experimental techniques
(such as cross-situational, artificial language and iterated learning paradigms) which is
complimented by corpus based analyses, in order to produce robust and comprehensive
empirical evidence. This approach is highly multidisciplinary, with the aim being to
answer and generate research questions that have implications for areas of psychology,
linguistics and the cognitive sciences.</p>
