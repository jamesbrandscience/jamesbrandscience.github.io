### Kia ora!

I am a Post-doctoral Research Fellow at [the NZILLB](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/nzilbb/) - University of Canterbury in New Zealand, researching the sociolinguistic factors of sound change.
Previously, I worked as a Post-doc in the [Embodied Cognition Lab](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/connelll/lab/) at [Lancaster University](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/psychology/).
I completed my PhD at Lancaster University under the supervision of [Prof Padraic Monaghan](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/monaghan/) and [Dr Peter Walker](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/psychology/people/peter-walker/)

#### Research Interests
How do cognitive biases shape our language? My research focuses on the different ways
that our language is shaped by the brain, addressing how language acquisition and use can
explain many fundamental properties of language. I adopt a variety of experimental techniques
(such as cross-situational, artificial language and iterated learning paradigms) which is
complimented by large scale, corpus based analyses, in order to produce robust and comprehensive
empirical evidence for my research questions. This approach is highly multidisciplinary, with the aim being to
answer and generate questions that have implications for areas of psychology,
linguistics and the cognitive sciences.
