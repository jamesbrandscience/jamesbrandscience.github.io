# What is Open Science?

## There are lots of definitions...

--

## In it's simplest form... just doing 'normal' science but more .NZILBBgreen[transparently]

# What is this workshop about?

## The purpose of this workshop is to introduce you to .NZILBBgreen[some] of the ways you can be more open

--

## This can involve introducing .NZILBBgreen[small] changes to your .NZILBBgreen['normal'] workflow

--

## You don't have to do .NZILBBgreen['everything'] to be an open scientist

--

## If you find some things useful great! ... .NZILBBgreen[Give them a go!]

---

# Who is this workshop for?

## Everybody!

--

## Open Science should be .NZILBBgreen[fundamentally inclusive], everybody learns from each other

--

## If you have concerns/questions/criticisms of the things being discussed here, .NZILBBgreen[let us know]

# Replicability

## The ability to replicate the work of somebody else, using independently collected data, but derived from the same methods

# Replicability

## Why is it important?

<ru-blockquote style = "font-size:40px">"The scientifically significant physical effect may be defined as that which can be regularly reproduced by anyone who carries out the appropriate experiment in the way prescribed"<br/><p align="right" style = "font-size:30px">Popper (1952: 23-24)</p></ru-blockquote>

---

# Replicability (critiques and responses)

## Replications are not a good use of time and resources, they do not warrant publication

--

### Sure, they do take time and resources. If the original paper did not find the same result, would it have been published? Should we value .NZILBBgreen[null results] the same way as significant results?

--

## Who gets to decide which is the correct result?

--

### Nobobody. But perhaps it can .NZILBBgreen[stimulate discussion] between groups when different results are found and understand why that might be

---

# Replicability (critiques and responses)

## The replication did not give the same result... this is because the participants were too different

--

### Sure, there will be differences from the original sample. Can this be explained from a .NZILBBgreen[theoretical standpoint]? If so, was it mentioned in the original submission?

--

## The replication did not give the same result... this is because the experiment was not run correctly

--

### Sure, no replication will be exactly the same. Did the original submission give enough .NZILBBgreen[reproducible] information to run it correctly?

# Reproducibility

## .NZILBBgreen[Example 2]

### <b>Claim:</b> People attending this workshop are statistically more awesome than people not attending this workshop

--

### <b>Method:</b> Asked 100 random people to rate on a scale of 1-10 how awesome workshop attendees and a sample of non-workshop attendess are

--

### <b>Result:</b> I ran a mixed-effects regression model, predicting awesomeness rating, with workshop attendance (attended or not attended) as the main effect, which was significant (p < 0.05)

# Reproducibility

## .NZILBBgreen[Example 3]


### <b>Claim:</b> Women are taller than men

# Reproducibility

## Small steps towards being more reproducible (we will revisit these later)

--

### Share your data, code, materials, anything that you have

--

### Ensure the things you share can be understood by others

--

### Don't manual edit data files (in Excel) then overwrite the master file

--

### Try to code, not click

--

### Idenitfy errors, don't hide them

# Reproducibility

## Ways being reproducible makes things easier (for myself)

--

### 1. It makes me more organised

--

### 2. It makes me understand what I have been doing

--

### 3. It makes me more confident

--

### 4. It (eventually) makes me more efficient

--

### 5. It makes me identify errors

---

# Reproducibility

## Ways being reproducible makes things easier (for others)

--

### 1. It allows others to understand your workflow

--

### 2. It allows others to learn

--

### 3. It allows others to pick up where you left off

--

### 4. It allows other to reproduce your work

--

### 5. It allows others to identify errors

# 3. Pre-registration

---

# Pre-registration

## The process of declaring key aspects of your research plan, prior to actually undertaking the research, using a time-stamped document

<img src="images/Preregister.png" alt="Cruise" style="position:absolute; top:400px; width:500px;"></img>

<a href="https://osf.io/prereg/?utm_source=cos_site&utm_medium=get_started_button&utm_campaign=PreReg_Challenge" style="position:absolute; top:600px">Open Science Framework pre-registration

---

# Pre-registration

## Why bother?

--

### <b>p-hacking:</b> when you decide to modify, change or adjust the original analysis approach to .NZILBBgreen[find] your p < 0.05 result

--

### <b>HARKing (Hypothesising After Results are Known):</b> when you decide to modify, change or adjust the original hypotheses to .NZILBBgreen[suit] your p < 0.05 result

--

## .NZILBBgreen[Pre-registration facilitates openness about what your original intentions were]

---

# Pre-registration

## .NZILBBgreen[p-hacking example]

### You generate a hypothesis

### You collect data from 15 participants to test the hypothesis

### You choose to look at the data and run your analyses

### The results are significant

### You think you should probably collect more data, but decide not to

---

# Pre-registration

## .NZILBBgreen[HARKing example]

### You generate a hypothesis

### You collect data from 50 participants

### You choose to look at the data and run your analyses

### The results do not support your hypothesis

### You change your hypothesis and generate a new one that suits the results

---

# Pre-registration

## p-hacking and HARKing are generally seen as not good practice

## They will likely result in studies that are low in power

## Or studies that do not have a strong theoretical motivation

## .NZILBBgreen[Pre-registering your studies, where you define your hypotheses, methods, analysis **BEFORE** running the study, will minimise the likelihood of these issues]

---

# Pre-registration

## Benefits?

## You .NZILBBgreen[formulate] your ideas from the outset

## It provides a .NZILBBgreen[time-stamped] version of your plan

## It allows .NZILBBgreen[others] to understand what you intended to do and why you chose to do it

## It is .NZILBBgreen[rewarding] when you plan works out, .NZILBBgreen[informative] when it does not

---

# Pre-registration

## If I pre-register, am I stuck with that plan forever?

### No. You can .NZILBBgreen[update] your pre-registration in response to the development of the project. Just try to avoid doing so after data collection

## If I pre-register, do I have to state a clear hypothesis?

### No. Hypotheses can be .NZILBBgreen[confirmatory], where you have a clear prediction about your results, or they can be .NZILBBgreen[exploratory], where you do not have a clear prediction about the results.<br/> .NZILBBgreen[Both are fine!] As long you specify in the first instance.

---

# Pre-registration

## Does it have to be very detailed?

### No. You can add as much detail as you want. Just be clear and honest.

## Does it take long?

### No. They can be completed in a few minutes. Deciding what to pre-register might take longer, but that is the reason pre-registration is sensible... .NZILBBgreen[it lets you decide on what you are going to do]

---

# Pre-registration

## Is there a template?

### Yes. We will complete one in the next part of the workshop

## What if things don't turn out as I predicted?

### That is doing science! If your results don't match your expectations, .NZILBBgreen[that is the result to report], there will be a reason why. Ultimately, these results should carry the same weight as 'publishable' results

---

# Pre-registration (2.0)

## Registered Reports

### Submit your research plan for peer-review, .NZILBBgreen[before data collection and analysis], normally with provisional acceptance to the journal

--

## Benefits?

### Makes any result a 'worthy' result

## See [https://cos.io/rr/](https://cos.io/rr/)

# Open access

## Different routes to Open Access?

## <a style = "color:green"> Green: </a> Allows users to deposit work prior to publication on accessible archive

## <a style = "color:gold"> Gold: </a> Makes the final published article accessible to all through the journal, at a cost to the author

## <a style = "color:#c0c0c0"> Diamond/platinum: </a> Essentially the gold route, but with no charge to the the author

---

# Open access

## What types of licenses?

### Adding a license to your pre-print is always useful as it can restrict/open the access of it

## <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/"> https://creativecommons.org/choose/

---

# Open access

## Pre-prints!

### You can archive your .NZILBBgreen[pre-submitted] manuscript, i.e. before it has undergone peer review at at journal

### There are lots of options to do this, they are normally free (we will do an example with OSF)

### They are time-stamped, so harder to plagiarise

### Gets your work out there faster

### Journals .NZILBBgreen[normally] fine with this practice
