### A year in a day

I am currently working on an experimental project which will hopefully culminate in a 
24-hour long compilation of naturalistic field recordings.

The intended plan for this involves taking audio recordings of wherever I am, one for each 
day of the year (365 days, but 2020 is a leap year so maybe one more). These recordings 
will last 3 minutes and 56 seconds each, which when combined together will give 24 hours 
worth of recordings (there are 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day, which gives 
1440 minutes, when this number is divided by the number of days in a year it gives 3 
minutes and 56 seconds).

The recordings will be taken at sequential time points, following the 24 hours in a day. 
The first recording will be taken at 9:00am, then on the next day it will be taken at 
9:00:56am and so forth.

The idea is that it will give an account of the sounds experienced over the course of a 
normal day, but a day that has actually lasted a year.

It is inspired in part by ![Viv Corringham's - On the Hour in the Woods](https://www.farpointrecordings.com/product-page/viv-corringham-on-the-hour-in-the-woods)
